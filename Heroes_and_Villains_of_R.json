					"Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, known to sailors and minstrels alike as Iceclaws, thanks to her habit of drifting low over ships sailing off the Sword Coast and plucking up crew members for quick snacks. This ancient white dragon is feared by all sailors who ply the shipping lanes of the Sword Coast, except for those who dismiss her as a legend -- until it's too late. The Flying Hunt of Nimbral and several aerial patrols from Evermeet have fought her in midair and forced her into flight on occasion, but most ships are helpless against her diving attacks -- and when crews scramble down into their holds to escape her snatching claws, she's been known to land on a ship and tear it apart like a child opening a gift. What makes Arveiaturace so deadly is she is the steed of a wizard, Meltharond Thone, who captured and tamed her centuries ago."

					"Everyone seems to agree that the Dark Lady who haunts Rundreth Manor now is something different - something that brings death to many handsome young men, sending others away alive but changed. The survivors return with a faraway look in their eyes and doom riding their shoulders like a dark, tattered cloak that curls and switches of its own volition.",
					"It's certain the young male adventurers lured to Rundreth believe they're in the company of someone very much alive -- and that the fearful few who come equipped to slay a vampire find no such foe and are persuaded to set aside their weapons by a friendly lady. Some who've seen this Dark Lady say she's small of stature, catlike in her grace, and clad in too little to conceal any weapon. And yet man after man of the young warriors who enter Rundreth is found dead -- torn apart as if by great jaws and tossed out onto the road, piece by piece, for flies and passersby to find.",
					"If we can believe the ballad of the minstrel Inder Braelen (who returned to the Manor several times before disappearing there four winters ago), the Lady brings men to the ruined house by the score for purposes of seduction -- or to rob and slay them. She usually kills such paramours but lets the occasional one go. Those who spread word of what happened to them, such as Inder, soon disappear. Those who hold their peace and remain friendly to the Dark Lady are suffered to live. Inder claimed that some of these men remain her willing servants lifelong, obviously still fostering a love for her.",
					"Inder's ballad lays bare two secrets of the Lady: Her habits, love of concealment, and the illusion magics she wields conceal her true nature from all save those who become her intimates - that she is a drow. Inder saw something more. The Dark Lady was more than a dark elf, or else a drow who could shapechange at will.",
					"Certain Harpers -- one lover of the Dark Lady among them -- know rather more about the deadly lady of Rundreth Manor, and between what Volo learned from them and what he'd overheard at a Mage Fair (before his writings made him widely unpopular among mages), he pieced together the truth about the Dark Lady -- facts Elminster has confirmed.",
					"Her name is Nurvureem, and she is a drow . . . and more. In fact, she's a drow song dragon, a drow who can change to a shadow dragon at will. A few veteran Harpers call her \"the Drow Dragon.\"",

If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors.
